A Comparison of Q-Learning and Classification Methodologies to Human Behavior in Stock Trading

Abstract - Our goal is to understand how in the stock trading domain humans make buy, sell and hold decisions as compared to two machine learning algorithms â€“ a Q-learning agent and a classification-based agent. Through conducting a behavioral experiment we aim to identify the nature of decisions made by humans and attempt to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the comparability of ML methods and human results to analyze how people versus machines approach the decision-making process.
